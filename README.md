## Design Patterns Project

This project serves as a collection of demonstrations for various software design patterns in Java.

Each pattern is organized as a separate module and is divided into two main subpackages:

- principle — Contains a minimal, focused implementation that illustrates the core idea of the pattern.

- example — Contains a more practical or real-world example that applies the pattern in context.

### Implemented patterns

✅ The Memento Pattern

Capture and externalize an object's internal state so that it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation.

✅ The Factory Method Pattern

This approach abstracts away the specifics of which class gets instantiated, encouraging flexible and loosely coupled code that aligns well with the dependency inversion principle.

✅ The Observer pattern

The Observer pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, A subject (publisher) maintains a list of observers.
